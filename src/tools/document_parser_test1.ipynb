We believe\\nthis represents a substantial leap forward in the capabilities of autonomous agents, paving the way for more\\nsophisticated and reliable decision-making in real-world settings.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant leap in artificial\\nintelligence. Frontier models like ChatGPT (John Schulman et al., 2022), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023),\\nOpus (Anthropic, 2024), and LLaMA-3 (Touvron et al., 2023) demonstrate promising reasoning\\ncapabilities that approach average human performance in a number of domains. These breakthroughs\\nhave extended the utility of LLMs from traditional chat and text-based applications to more dynamic,\\nagentic roles, in which they do not just generate text but can take actions autonomously in a number\\nof environments including code and software engineering (Holt et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024;\\nYang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024d), device control (Chen and Li, 2024; Wang et al., 2024a;\\nZhang et al., 2023) and web applications (Deng et al., 2023; Gur et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2023; Lai\\net al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2024b) among others. However, despite these advancements, significant\\nchallenges persist: LLMs still struggle to generalize effectively in interactive, multi-step environments,\\nsince they are not native trained for such applications . This is true, even for some of the strongest\\nmodels of the current generation, such as GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023).\\nA growing literature on agentic formulation seeks to address these issues; however these works mostly\\nfocus on building frameworks around prompt-based learning on existing models or limited fine-tuning\\non static datasets, and are thus limited by the base models’ reasoning and decision making capabilities.\\nReasoning and planning have indeed been highlighted as core challenges for current LLMs. Since the\\nseminal work on chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), significant efforts have been made\\nto improve these capabilities via prompt-based strategies (Kojima et al., 2022; Qiao et al., 2023;\\nCorresponding author(s): div@multion.ai, rafailov@stanford.edu\\narXiv:2408.07199v1  [cs.AI]  13 Aug 2024'),\n",

Another direction of research has explored fine-tuning approaches (Pang\\net al., 2024; Zelikman et al., 2022), and more recently combining them with inference-time search\\nprompting (Yao et al., 2023a) to produce fine-grained feedback.

Our method takes inspiration from Sutton’s The Bitter\\nLesson on the power of general purpose methods that continue to scale with increased computation,\\nshowing the significant benefits of combiningsearch and learning.\\nInspired by the success of search-based methods in prior game-playing settings (Brown and Sandholm,\\n2019; Gray et al., 2021; Silver et al., 2017a) and mathematical reasoning (Besta et al., 2024; Yao\\net al., 2023a), we deploy a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based search routine over web pages to\\nguide agent exploration.

While this simple search-strategy shows a meaningful\\nimprovement in the success rate, it still struggles on long horizon tasks due to sparsity of environment\\nrewards. Indeed even a small mistake across the trajectory can cause the final agent output to be\\nwrong, creating significant credit assignment problems. To overcome this, we use AI feedback (Bai\\net al., 2022) and self-criticism (Yuan et al., 2024) to further prompt the LLM to provide self-evaluation\\nfeedback at each node, which serves as intermediate reward and helps guide the search steps. This\\nmeaningfully improves the final agent success rate, but requires significant online interactions and\\nmoreover the capability to rollback actions, which is not always possible in online realistic settings.\\nSuch online autonomous search with little supervision on the web can result in a weak or unsafe\\nagent which can make many errors, resulting in risky behaviors in sensitive online settings like bank\\ntransfers and sensitive information sharing.\\nTo correct this, we use the traces generated by the search process to improve capabilities of the\\nmodel by learning from both the successful and unsuccessful trajectories with offline reinforcement\\nlearning, utilizing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. We create preferences over\\ndifferent branches at the node level, which are scored using a mixture of the AI process feedback\\nrewards and the final success rate of the explored branch.

Related Work\\nOur work touches on a large number of research directions around agent design, self-improvement,\\nreasoning and reinforcement learning. We include a short overview of related works from those\\nvarious fields below.\\n2.1. Guided Search for Reasoning and Planning\\nThe latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising emerging\\nproperties around reasoning and planning. Moreover such behaviours can be directly elicited from\\nstrong models only using simple prompting techniques (Kojima et al., 2022; Qiao et al., 2023; Wei\\net al., 2022). These have also become an integral part of agentic design (Yao et al., 2023b; Zhang\\net al., 2024c), which we also utilize for our approach. Another emerging research direction is based\\naround step-by-step verifiers or “Process Reward Models” (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022),\\nspecifically for mathematical reasoning. These have shown to improve performance beyond purely\\noutcome-based training, however they require a large amount of human effort to label individual\\nsteps. Some recent approaches have proposed self-supervised methods for step-level supervision\\n(Hwang et al., 2024; Setlur et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b). A number of concurrent works (Tian\\net al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024e) have further explored tree-based search approaches\\n3'),\n",

Our approach shares similarities to the self-supervised search\\nproposed in (Yao et al., 2023a) with a combination of AI-based feedback (Bai et al., 2022; Yuan et al.,\\n2024) to guide intermediate search steps, but we are the first to scale this a realistic agent setting.\\nSimilar approaches were proposed in (Hao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a), and other works (Koh\\net al., 2024); however these works only use the base model’s zero-shot capability and do not train it\\nfurther. Moreover they are only evaluated on simulated environments. Beyond the search stage, our\\nwork further adopts the training methodology of (Tian et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Zhang et al.,\\n2024e), which significantly boosts our agent’s zero-shot capabilities.\\n2.2. Web Agents\\nThe strength and capabilities of recent pretrained Large Language (Vision) Models LL(V)Ms has\\nsignificantly boosted progress in developing autonomous web-agents. Improved code understanding\\nand long context have allowed agents to represent environment state and action space with document\\nobject model (DOM) allowing for deployment in complex and realistic domains. Moreover strong\\nreasoning (Yao et al., 2023b) and planning (Liu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024c) capabilities have also\\nled to the development of a number of promising agents (Deng et al., 2023; Gur et al., 2024; Hong\\net al., 2023; Zhang and Zhang, 2023; Zhou et al., 2024b). Beyond using LL(V)Ms as plug-and-play\\nplanners/policies, recent works have sought to improve agentic-specific performance. Examples\\ninclude online exploration (Zhang et al., 2024a), planning (Zhang et al., 2024b), error-correction\\n(Wang et al., 2024a), and self- (Wu et al., 2024) or AI-critique (He et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2024).\\nHowever, with small exceptions (Nakano et al., 2022) (which is still limited in scope) these agents\\nmostly provide a framework around a strong pre-existing model like GPT4-V or deploy limited\\nfine-tuning and adaptation. In this work we show that model training is crucial for continuous\\nimprovement. We combine a planning and reasoning agent with MCTS inference-time search and AI\\nself-critique for self-supervised data collection, which we then use for RL type training.\\n2.3. Reinforcement Learning for LLMs and Agents\\nReinforcement Learning has become a significant component of training modern generative AI systems\\n(Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). Classical approaches have deployed the\\nPPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017)—or similar policy-gradient based methods—and have even\\nbeen scaled to autonomous web search agents (Nakano et al., 2022) as well as embodied applications\\nwith vision-language models (Zhai et al., 2024) (in simulation). However, these algorithms are\\nchallenging due to their complexity and the need for a high number of online samples from the\\nmodel. This is especially prominent in potentially risky situations, such as autonomous agentic models\\nthat could make a number of impactful mistakes during training. Implicit Language Q-learning\\n(Snell et al., 2022) and the Q-transformer (Chebotar et al., 2023) are offline RL algorithms (Levine\\net al., 2020) designed for auto-regressive transformer models, and hence can be safely trained on\\npre-collected datasets; however they have not been successfully scaled to modern LLMs. While these\\nmethods represent a token-level MDP, (Zhou et al., 2024c) has shown success formulating the RL\\nproblem at a step level and these ideas have recently been scaled to a general device-control agent\\n(Bai et al., 2024). However, these algorithms still have high complexity and require auxiliary models,\\nsuch as value functions, so instead in our approach we opt to use the Direct Preference Optimization\\n(DPO) algorithm (Rafailov et al., 2023) due to it’s simplicity and natural fit for the branching nature\\nof tree-search based data.\\n4'),\n",

A POMDP is the most suitable framework to model web interactions for several\\nreasons - first novel environments, which the agent is unfamiliar with require exploration in order\\nto locate the task objective, consistent with the meta-reinforcement learning as task inference view\\nHumplik et al. (2019). Moreover, the real web is dynamic, which creates partial observability of\\nthe current state each time the agent is deployed - i.e. it does not a priori know current booking\\navailability before attempting to do it. We will outline the main parts of our web agent below.\\nThe agent observationo𝑡 ∈𝒪 are commands/information given by the user and the web browser.\\nThe first observationo1 is a user text instruction, such as\\n\"Book reservation for restaurant Cecconi’s on OpenTable for 4 people on May 22 2024 at 7:00 PM\"\\nfor example and a browser home page. Subsequent observations consist of web pages from the\\nbrowser, represented as a HTML DOM format. Occasionally for some tasks the agent might ask for\\nconfirmation/feedback from the user, which then also becomes part of the observation.\\n5'),\n",

Moreover realistic web-tasks can require many more interactions than static benchmarks such\\nas WebShop Yao et al. (2022) and WebArena Zhou et al. (2024b), which most prior works use. This\\nmakes it impractical to use full web trajectories due to limited context windows, potential out-of-\\ndistribution issues and practical inference speed and cost. Instead, we build the history representation\\nof the agent ash𝑡 = (a1, . . . ,a𝑡−1, o𝑡). That is, the agent history consists of the actions generated\\nso far and the current browser state. With some abuse of notation we will also refer to this as the\\nagent state. Even though only the environment action is used for interacting with the browser, we\\nconstruct the agent thought and explanation actions to act as a form of inner monologue Huang et al.\\n(2022b) and adequately represent its state and intentions. This allows us to use a significantly more\\ncompact history representation. We should note that, while only the environment action affects the\\nbrowser state, the planning, reasoning and explanation components affect subsequent decisions due\\nto conditioning. Because of this reason, when we optimize the agent, we compute likelihoods over\\nthe composite action.\\n3.2.

The environment comes with a set of 12,087 pre-defined tasks (corresponding to specific\\nproducts to find), which we split into a train set of 11,000 tasks, which we use for further agent\\nfine-tuning and a set of 1,087 held-out tasks, which we use for zero-shot evaluation. We show success\\nrates (exact product match) for different approaches in Fig. 3. The base xLAM-v0.1-r model achieves\\nsuccess rate of 28.6% on the test tasks.

We see that further RFT\\ntraining, using a STaR-like algorithm Zelikman et al. (2022) on the trajectory level, as outlined in\\nSec. 3.2.1, achieves success rate of 31.3%, which is a small improvements of 2.7% over the initial\\nmodel. This is not surprising since the base model is already trained as an agent on the environment\\nwith supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations. Our next experiment fine-tunes the base model using\\nthe trajectory-level DPO algorithm, as outlined in Eq. 6 in Sec. 3.2.2 using successful trajectories as\\npreferred over failed ones. This approach also uses only outcome-level supervision, but unlike the\\nRFT baseline can utilize failed trajectories as well, which improves the agent performance by 9.3%\\nover RFT agent to 40.6% success rate. We also evaluate this model with beam search for the action\\ngeneration, which can be considered a form of planning the horizon of a single environment action\\n(which still consists of multiple simple actions) Rafailov et al.

(2024).\\nDespite the additional reinforcement learning training, our agents are still not able to match the\\naverage human performance on this environment.

Agent Search\\nAs we discovered in the previous section, while training based on outcome supervision with DPO\\nyields meaningful improvement, the model is still not able to match human performance due to\\nit’s limited exploration. In this section we will explore endowing the agent with additional search\\ncapability via MCTS.\\n5.1. Monte-Carlo Tree Search Over Web-Pages\\nThe Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm Kocsis and Szepesvári (2006) employed in this\\nwork follows closely the one in Hao et al. (2023) and consists of four phases: selection, expansion,\\nsimulation, and backpropagation. Each phase plays a critical role in balancing exploration and\\nexploitation while iteratively refining the policy.\\nWe formulate the web agent execution as tree search over web-pages. The state is represented as\\ndescribed in Section 3.1 and consist of the summary of the agent’s history and the DOM tree of\\nthe current web-page. Unlike board games, such as Chess or Go Silver et al. (2017b) the complex\\nweb-agent action space we use is open-format and variable. Instead we will use the base model as an\\naction-proposal distribution and sample a fixed amount of possible actions at each node (web-page).\\nOnce we select and execute an action in the browser we traverse the next web-page, which together\\nwith the updated history becomes the new node.\\n5.1.1. Action Selection With AI Process Supervision\\nThe selection phase uses the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) formulation of MCTS also used by Hao\\net al. (2023) to select nodes which aims to balance exploration and exploitation. With some abuse of\\nnotation we will also denote the agent state withh𝑡.

Using MCTS on top of the trained Agent Q\\nmodel further improves performance to 50.5% slightly out-performing the average human success\\nrates. We find that the ability to search at test time is a significant paradigm shift from zero-shot\\nagents, even with significant RL training. Furthermore, while dense-level supervision improves over\\npurely outcome-based one, the improvement is modest on WebShop. This is because the environment\\nrequires relatively short trajectories, and the model is capable to learn credit assignment purely from\\noutcome supervision.

Discussion\\nIn this work we developed algorithms for autonomous improvement of web-agents with limited human\\nsupervision. While most prior works build frameworks around existing models without additional\\ntraining, we specifically seek to fine-tune pre-trained models for web navigation tasks based on\\nsynthetic reasoning and search data. While we achieve significant improvement in model capabilities\\non our target domain, many research questions remain.\\nDesign of reasoning algorithms.The core challenge for our web agents is the weak reasoning\\ncapabilities, which limit the agent’s exploration and search strategy. In our approach we used process-\\nlevel supervision from a separate critic model, which we prompt to rank possible agent actions. This\\nis in contrast to works in mathematical reasoning where PRMs are usually trained to classify the\\ncorrectness of individual steps Lightman et al. (2023), while other agent works Koh et al. (2024)\\nhave prompted models as zero-shot value functions. Furthermore, while we spent significant effort in\\ntraining the agent policy, we maintain a frozen critic, which would likely also benefit from additional\\nfine-tuning. We defer exploration of these design choices to further work.\\nChoice of search algorithm.We used MCTS search due to the approach’s prior success in mathemat-\\nical and code reasoning tasks. However, agent models executing MCTS on live environments might\\nrequire significant number of risky interactions and a different search strategy might be more suitable.\\nRecent works such as Gandhi et al. (2024); Lehnert et al. (2024) have even suggested directly learning\\nto optimally search and explore in reasoning tasks using meta-reinforcement learning. We believe\\nthis is a promising research direction for autonomous agents, which we will pursue in further work.\\nDiscrepancy between zero-shot vs search results.Similar to some recent works that focus on code\\nand reasoning, we observe significant gap between zero-shot agent performance and performance of\\nthe agent equipped with search capabilities Brown et al. (2024); Snell et al. (2024). Investigating\\nthese trade-offs at scale and the potential effect of different search/optimization approaches.\\nOnline safety and interaction.The design of agent Q allows for largely autonomous exploration,\\nself-evaluation and improvement with limited human intervention. However, the agent might make a\\nsignificant number of mistakes in it’s search process which might be difficult to fix/reverse, especially\\nfor safety-critical online transactions, such as communications/email, payments, filings etc. This limits\\nthe scope of websites that Agent Q can be safely deployed and we might require additional safety\\ncritics and human-in-the-loop training setups.\\n15'),\n",

Individual agents have been developed for various applications\\nincludingcoding(5;8),webbrowsing(64;42),andgameplay(48).\\nRecentresearcheffortsinLLM-poweredmulti-agentsystemsgenerallyfallunderthreecategories: pro-\\nductivity, games, and social modeling. Multi-agent frameworks have been deployed in software de-\\nvelopment (43; 27), cooperative robotic control (60), scientific experiments (12; 47), and debates (3).\\nMulti-agent simulations have also been tested in various game environments (56; 13; 30; 28). Sepa-\\nrately, they’ve been used to model developmental psychology (25; 61), game theory (32), macroeco-\\nnomics(29;63),socialpolicies(41;54;19),andcommunitydynamics(40;39;10).\\nInmanyoftheseworks,agentsarenotcompletelyautonomousandareconstrainedbyeitheragentar-\\nchitecture or by the simulated environment.

An immediate challenge with concurrent modules is that they can produce independent\\noutputs, making the agent incoherent. For instance, agents say one thing but actually do something\\nelse.\\nCurrent state. The incoherence problem is usually not obvious for sequential architectures or sys-\\ntems with only one output modality but is a significant problem when multiple output modules can\\ninterface with the environment. Incoherence also scales exponentially as the number of independent\\noutput modules increases, for instance, coordinating actions involving arms, legs, facial expressions,\\ngazeandspeech.

In order to ensure that the multiple outputs produced by our agents are coherent, we in-\\ntroduced a Cognitive Controller (CC) module (23) that is solely responsible for making high-level de-\\nliberate decisions. These decisions are then translated downstream to produce appropriate outputs in\\neachmotormodule.\\nThe Cognitive Controller synthesizes information across the Agent State through a bottleneck.
