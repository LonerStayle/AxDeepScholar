Table 1: Stratification of Common Datasets Providing Facts
3.1.1
Data Dependency
The dataset D can be segmented into documents or segments, denoted as D1, D2, . . . , Dn, in various ways:
D = {D1, D2, . . . , Dn}
(2)
Each segment Di is considered relatively short and contains content that is more focused and specific2.
For a given query q ∈Q, not every segment within D is requisite for formulating a response. Let δ : Q × D →{0, 1}
denote the necessity of data segment d ∈D for a specific query q, where δ(q, d) = 1 means that data segment d is
required to answer the query q, and δ(q, d) = 0 otherwise. Then the data dependency of query q, characterized by the
subset of segments indispensable for addressing query q, is defined as:
Dep(q) = {d | d ∈D and δ(q, d) = 1}
(3)
It’s easy to understand that Dep(q) ∈P(D), where P(D) is the power set3 of D.
3.1.2
Definition
Explicit fact queries, denoted as Q1, are characterized by the direct retrievability of answers from specific data segments
within the dataset D. These queries can be formally defined in the context of a data-augmented LLM system as follows:
For any query q and its corresponding answer a, an explicit fact query is one where there exists:
• A retrieval component rD : Q →P(D) that identifies the relevant data segments from D necessary to answer
q. This component ensures that rD(q) closely matches Dep(q), the minimal subset of D required to respond
to q.
• A response generator θ, typically a prompted LLM inference, that constructs the answer a based solely on the
information retrieved by rD. The response θ(rD(q)) should be equal to or approximate a, demonstrating the
query’s reliance on explicit, directly accessible facts.
2In some most recent advancements, the segment size may be as large as a whole document or even larger
3The power set (or powerset) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.
