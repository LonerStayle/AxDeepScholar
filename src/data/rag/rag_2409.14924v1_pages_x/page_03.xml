Figure 1: Main Focus of Four Level Queries
expected to handle. Below, we delineate these levels, providing insights into the unique challenges and capabilities
necessitated at each stage.
Level-1 Explicit Facts: These queries are asking about explicit facts directly present in the given data without
requiring any additional reasoning. This is the simplest form of query, where the model’s task is primarily to
locate and extract the relevant information. For example, "Where will the 2024 Summer Olympics be held?"
targets a fact contained in the external data.
Level-2 Implicit Facts: These queries ask about implicit facts in the data, which are not immediately obvious and
may require some level of common sense reasoning or basic logical deductions. The necessary information
might be spread across multiple segments or require simple inferencing. For instance, the question "What is
the majority party now in the country where Canberra is located?" can be answered by combining the fact
that Canberra is in Australia with the information about the current majority party in Australia.
Level-3 Interpretable Rationales: These queries demand not only a grasp of the factual content but also the capacity
to comprehend and apply domain-specific rationales that are integral to the data’s context. These rationales
are often explicitly provided in external resources and is typically not present or rarely encountered during the
pre-training phase of a general large language model. For example, in the realm of pharmaceuticals, an LLM
must interpret FDA Guidance1 documents—which represent the FDA’s current thinking—to evaluate whether
a specific drug application adheres to regulatory requirements. Similarly, in customer support scenarios, the
LLM must navigate the intricacies of a predefined workflow to process user inquiries effectively. In the medical
field, many diagnostic manuals provide authoritative and standardized diagnostic criteria, such as management
guidelines for patients with acute chest pain [14]. By effectively following these external rationales, it is
possible to develop a specialized LLM expert system for managing chest pain. This involves understanding
the procedural steps and decision trees that guide a support agent’s interactions with customers, ensuring
responses are not only accurate but also comply with the company’s service standards and protocols.
Level-4 Hidden Rationales: This category of queries delves into the more challenging realm where the rationales are
not explicitly documented but must be inferred from patterns and outcomes observed in external data. The
hidden rationales here refer not only to the implicit reasoning chains and logical relationships, but also to the
inherently challenging and non-trivial task of identifying and extracting the external rationales required for
each specific query. In IT operational scenarios, for example, a cloud operations team may have addressed
numerous incidents in the past, each with its own unique set of circumstances and resolutions. The LLM must
be adept at mining this rich repository of tacit knowledge to discern the implicit strategies and decision-making
