adapter to refine the output of retriever[80]. Additionally, some research focuses on pre-training a small language model
dedicated to fact verification, which is used to filter out incorrect retrieved text chunks, thus improving the quality of
the recalled text[81].
Recursive Retrieval or Iterative Retrieval Considering the inherent limitations in the accuracy of a single retrieval
attempt, an effective mitigation strategy is to perform multiple retrievals to progressively address any omissions. Kim et
al. (2023) introduced a tree-like recursive retrieval method, incorporating pruning strategies to incrementally break
down ambiguous questions into disambiguated ones, ultimately arriving at the closest correct answer [82]. Similarly,
SEATER uses the k-means algorithm to construct a hierarchical tree structure of items to be retrieved, and iteratively
recalls nodes within the tree structure [83].

Response Generation Enhancement
Generating responses requires determining if the retrieved information is sufficient or if additional external data is
needed. Handling conflicts between retrieved knowledge and the model’s internal prior knowledge is also essential
[84, 85, 86]. Supervised fine-tuning is an effective method to enhance the generation performance in RAG systems.
When faced with irrelevant or erroneous information as the retrieved context, pre-trained large language models are
often easily misled, resulting in incorrect responses. Many studies have shown that by subtly designing training data
for RAG systems, fine-tuning or pretraining can effectively mitigate this issue [87, 88, 89]. Through experimental
analysis, RAAT [89], demonstrated that the detrimental effects of irrelevant retrieval noise, relevant retrieval noise, and
counterfactual retrieval noise on RAG models increase progressively. By incorporating with these training process,
these methods enables the LLM to internally recognize noisy contexts, leading to significant improvements in response
generation quality even in the presence of noisy retrievals. Furthermore, to ensure more consistent performance between
the retriever and generator within the RAG system, some studies employ joint training of both retriever and generator
during the training phase [90, 91, 92].

Implicit Fact Queries (L2)
4.1
Overview
These queries involve data dependencies that are not immediately obvious and may require some level of common
sense reasoning or basic logical deductions. The necessary information might be spread across multiple segments or
require simple inferencing. (Example in Figure 2)
Queries at this level require gathering and processing information from multiple documents within the collection. The
collection of required information may exceed the ability of a single retrieval request, necessitating the decomposition
