Figure 2: Summary of Query Levels in Data augmented LLM applications
processes that were successful. Similarly, in software development, the debugging history of previous bugs
can provide a wealth of implicit insights. While the step-by-step rationale for each debugging decision may
not be systematically recorded, the LLM must be capable of extracting the underlying principles that guided
those decisions. By synthesizing these hidden rationales, the LLM can generate responses that are not only
accurate but also reflective of the unspoken expertise and problem-solving approaches that have been honed
over time by experienced professionals.
In summary, the classification of queries into levels reflects a gradient of complexity and the type of understanding
required from the LLM. As shown in Figure 1 and exampled by Figure 2, the first two levels, Explicit Facts and
Implicit Facts, focus on the retrieval of factual information, whether directly stated or requiring basic inferencing.
These levels challenge the LLM’s ability to extract and synthesize data into coherent facts. Conversely, the latter two
levels, Interpretable Rationales and Hidden Rationales, shift the focus towards the LLM’s capacity to learn and
apply the rationales behind the data. These levels demand a deeper cognitive engagement, where the LLM must align
with expert thinking or extract wisdom from unstructured historical data, respectively. The classification of common
factual querying datasets according to this standard is depicted in Table 1.
Each level presents its unique set of challenges and, consequently, necessitates tailored solutions to effectively address
them. As we delve into the intricacies of these levels in the following sections, we will explore the specific strategies
and methodologies that enable LLMs to navigate the complexities of data-augmented applications across these varied
spectrums of query types. This exploration will not only highlight the current capabilities of LLMs but also shed light
on the ongoing advancements and potential future developments in the field.

Explicit Fact Queries (L1)
3.1
Overview
Explicit fact queries, represent the most straightforward type of data-augmented queries. Queries at this level can be
answered by directly accessing specific domain documents or document snippets within the collection. The answers to
these questions are often in plain text within the documents, requiring minimal reasoning or simple rationale in the
response generation.
The defining characteristic of this level is the clear and direct dependency on specific pieces of external data.
