Hidden Rationale Queries (L4)
6.1
Overview
Hidden rationale queries are the most challenging type of queries to address. Unlike interpretable rationale queries,
which provide clear guidance on the rationales needed to respond to queries, hidden rationale queriesinvolve domain-
specific reasoning method that may not be explicitly described and are too numerous to exhaust. These rationales
often encompass a wide variety that cannot be fully explored within the typical context window and may lack clear
instructions, representing a form of domain expertise that is implicit within the data. Such data might include, but is not
limited to:
• In-domain Data: Hidden rationale queries might utilize data from the same domain, such as historical
question-and-answer records or artificially generated data. This in-domain data inherently contains the
reasoning skills or methodologies necessary to address current queries. For instance, in the context of Python
programming puzzles, solutions to historical problems often include classical algorithms and problem-solving
strategies that could aid in resolving current issues.
• Preliminary Knowledge: Another form of hidden rationales consists of extensive, dispersed knowledge
bases that vary in application across different scenarios. This preliminary knowledge may constitute a
comprehensive axiomatic system, such as all local legal codes that form the basis for legal judgments. It could
also include proven intermediate conclusions that simplify reasoning processes in fields like mathematical
proofs. When addressing real-world issues using external data, this prior knowledge might also stem from
complex accumulations of human experiences and empirical summaries.
Navigating hidden rationale queriesthus demands sophisticated analytical techniques to decode and leverage the latent
wisdom embedded within disparate data sources, presenting significant challenges for RAG systems in effectively
interpreting and applying such intricate and implicit information.
Here are some examples of queries at this level:
• How will the economic situation affect the company’s future development? (given a collection of financial
reports, with economic and financial rationale required)
• How to achieve 24 points using the numbers 5, 5, 5, and 1? (given a series of 24-point game examples and
corresponding answers.)
• Does Afghanistan permit a parent to confer his or her citizenship on a child born abroad? (given the
GLOBALCIT citizenship law dataset [136])

Challenges and Solutions
The construction of data-augmented LLM applications is significantly challenged by hidden rationale queries, with
primary difficulties manifesting in the following areas:
• Logical retrieval: For questions involving hidden rationales, the helpfulness of external data does not simply
depend on entity-level or semantic similarity, but rather on logical congruence or thematic alignment. Standard
retrieval methods often struggle to capture the true target of the query or to identify text segments with logical
similarities based on the problem presented. This necessitates the development of more sophisticated retrieval
algorithms that can parse and identify underlying logical structures rather than relying solely on superficial
textual similarities.
• Data insufficiency: Fundamentally, external data may not explicitly contain the guidance or answers relevant
to the current query. Instead, relevant information is often embedded in dispersed knowledges or illustrated
through examples. This indirect presentation demands robust capabilities in data interpretation and synthesis,
requiring LLMs to effectively derive coherent answers from fragmented or tangentially related data sources.
Such challenges underscore the imperative for sophisticated data integration and reasoning capabilities within
LLM frameworks to navigate the complexities of hidden rationale querieseffectively.

Offline Learning
To address these types of queries, a common approach is to identify and extract rules and guidelines from datasets
offline, subsequently retrieving related items. For generate reasoning rationales, some work like STaR [137] and
LXS [138] used LLM for rationale generation. The former employs an iterative few-shot example method to generate
