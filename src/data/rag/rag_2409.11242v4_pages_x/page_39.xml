Table 24: Prompt used for acquiring domain labels and knowledge demanding score.
Prompt
The examples below are questions from the same cluster.
Identify a single short topic they share
in common, for example:
Philosophy, Lifestyle, Linear Algebra, Biochemistry, Economics, etc.
Additionally, evaluate if the topics in the examples are broadly suitable as knowledge-demanding
questions that require additional research or grounding.
Exclude any sensitive, inappropriate, or
irrelevant content, such as sex, explicit violence, ads &amp; scams, and other NSFW subjects.
Consider
a wide range of content, including scientific, educational, historical, cultural, and practical
applications.
Provide a rating from 1 to 7 based on the topic’s dependence on additional knowledge
or search materials:
a score of 1 indicates the question can be answered with common sense alone,
without needing any additional information lookup; a score of 5 means the topic requires a combination
of common sense and additional lookup, roughly an equal split between the two; a score of 7 indicates
that answering the question directly would be difficult, and without additional information, the answer
would likely be incorrect.
The output format should be like this:
Topic:
the topic, Demanding value
rating:
score.
