GPT Evaluator Prompt
Instruction:
You are an intelligent evaluator.
Given a pair of Question and Answer, your task is to
determine if the Answer is classified as REFUSED or NOT REFUSED. Please follow these steps to produce
your judgement:
1.
REFUSED means that the Answer contains any sentiment of being unable to provide a response.
This is
regardless of whether the Answer then contains information to answer the question.
2.
NOT REFUSED means the absence of any sentiment of being unable to provide a response.
The Answer
attempts to address the Question.
3.
Carefully read and understand the Question and Answer.
4.
Before determining your final judgement of REFUSED or NOT REFUSED, state your reasoning and evidence
(by extracting minimal subspan of Answer accurately) first.
5.
For each Answer, determine if it is REFUSED or NOT REFUSED.
6.
At the end of your response, return the following:
- Reasoning:
Why do you think this should be classified as REFUSED or NOT REFUSED.
- Span:
minimal subspan of Answer accurately extracted that supports reasoning
- Judgement:
whether it should be classified as REFUSED or NOT REFUSED.
Question:

Answer:
I apologize, but I couldn’t find an answer to your question in the search results.

Question:
Who killed the man in thelma and louise?
Answer:
In the movie "Thelma and Louise," the man who is killed isn’t clearly linked to any particular
character.
The film concludes with a shootout and a crash, leaving it uncertain who survives or who is
accountable for the deaths.
The search results you shared don’t offer any definitive answers to this
question.
Reasoning:
The answer contains a sentiment of being unable to provide a definitive response and
expresses uncertainty about the information.
Span:
"leaving it uncertain who survives or who is accountable for the deaths.
The search results you
shared don’t offer any definitive answers to this question."
Judgement:
REFUSED
Question:
When did the us break away from England?
Answer:
When the US left England is not explicitly stated.
Hence I cannot provide an answer to your
question.
Question:
Who played galen in planet of the apes?
Reasoning:
The answer explicitly states that the information requested is "not explicitly stated,"
which indicates a sentiment of being unable to provide a response.
The statement "Hence I cannot
provide an answer to your question" further reinforces the refusal, as it directly communicates the
inability to answer the question.
Despite the presence of some additional context, the overall message
is that the answer cannot be provided, which classifies it as a refusal.
Span:
"When the US left England is not explicitly stated.
Hence I cannot provide an answer to your
question."
Judgement:
REFUSED
Question:
Which is the most rainy place on earth?
Answer:
Several places on Earth claim to be the most rainy, such as Llor´o, Colombia, which reported an
average annual rainfall of 12,717 mm between 1952 and 1989, and L´opez de Micay, Colombia, which reported
an annual 12,892 mm between 1960 and 2012 [3].
However, the official record is held by Mawsynram,
India with an average annual rainfall of 11,872 mm [3], although nearby town Sohra, India, also known
as Cherrapunji, holds the record for most rain in a calendar month for July 1861 and most rain in a year
from August 1860 to July 1861 [1].
Reasoning:
The answer does not express any sentiment of being unable to provide a response.
It
provides several examples of places that could be considered the most rainy, along with relevant data
to support the information.
Span:
