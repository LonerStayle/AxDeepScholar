Insufficient case
Question:
Why do burns blister and why do burn wounds remain warm
long after the injury occurred?
Label:
Burn blisters occur when the second layer of the skin is
damaged, they occur to protect the underlying skin layers from more
damage and infection.
You could see it as the bodys/skins natural
bandage, so never pop them.
The skin remain warm because of the
increased blood in the area to repair and replace the damaged skin.
Decomposed claims:
1.
Burn blisters occur when the second layer of skin is damaged.
2.
Burn wounds remain warm due to increased blood flow to the area
to repair and replace damaged skin.
Missing points:
1.
Protection and Infection:
The first claim does not mention that
the blisters protect the underlying skin from more damage and
infection, which is a significant part of the explanation in the
answer.
2.
Never Pop Them:
The answer advises against popping blisters,
which is a preventive measure not mentioned in the claims.
Redundant case
Question:
How do fitness trackers know that you actually sleeping
but not just laying there resting, being awake?
Label:
Your heart beats slows down when you sleep, they will use a
mixture of heart rate and how long you haven’t moved to determine how
you’ve slept
Decomposed claims:
1.
The combined factors of heart rate and
inactivity determine sleep assessment.
2.
Fitness trackers consider the duration of inactivity to assess
sleep.
3.
A slowed heart rate is an indicator of sleep that fitness
trackers monitor.
Redundant point:
The first claim has already summarised the core
statement, and the last two claims just expand it and give more
details

ADAPTABILITY WITH DIFFERENT ALIGNMENT TECHNIQUES
To demonstrate the robustness of our synthesized alignment data across different training methods,
Table 14 also includes the performance of SFT and SIMPO (Meng et al., 2024) methods. Compared
to the SFT baseline, which only utilizes the positive data points in the alignment pairs to fine-tune
the base model, preference optimization methods, such as DPO and SIMPO, consistently show per-
formance improvements, highlighting the versatility of our data pipeline. Unlike the SFT approach,
DPO and SIMPO demonstrate improved TRUST scores, albeit with a reduction in responsiveness.
This decrease in responsiveness is actually a favorable outcome, as it indicates that the models are
less likely to attempt to answer questions for which they lack sufficient information.
