Table 8: Case study showcasing the limitations of substring matching and necessity of TRUE judge-
ment.
Question
How many state parks are there in Virginia?
Gold Answer
38
Retrieved document
Virginia has 30 National Park Service units, such as Great Falls Park and
the Appalachian Trail, and one national park, the Shenandoah National
Park. With over 500 miles of trails, including 38 miles of the iconic
Appalachian Trail, it’s a paradise for hikers, nature lovers, and those
seeking serene mountain landscapes.
Substring match
Substring is matched and as such the question is answerable.
TRUE Judgement
Not entailed as such the question is unanswerable given the document.

ATTRIBUTABLE RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been widely studied for reducing the knowledge gap
and providing more referenced information to enhance answer generation (Karpukhin et al., 2020;
Lewis et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2023c). However, LLMs are prone to being misled by irrelevant
information, leading to hallucinations and less factual outputs (Shi et al., 2023; Yoran et al., 2024;
Xu et al., 2023). This challenge has spurred research into attributable RAG, which aims to verify
model outputs by identifying supporting sources. Rashkin et al. (2022) first introduced the concept
of Attributable to Identified Sources (AIS) to evaluate attribution abilities. Subsequently, Gao et al.
(2023b) adapted this approach to verify generated content with citations, improving the reliability
of RAG systems. Simultaneously, Press et al. (2024) and Song et al. (2024) explored related as-
pects: citation attribution for paper identification and the verifiability of long-form generated text,
respectively. Further fine-grained evaluations have been examined, such as assessing the degree
of support (Zhang et al., 2024b) and the granularity of claims (Xu et al., 2024). Recent studies
(Buchmann et al., 2024; Hsu et al., 2024) have also investigated attribution ability by disentangling
the confounding effects of retrievers and LLMs. Unlike existing works, we design TRUST-SCORE
to prioritize trustworthiness in LLMs by ensuring that generated responses are strictly grounded in
the provided documents, thereby minimizing the generation of unverifiable content. This focus on
verifiable accuracy strengthens the reliability of LLM outputs and enhances user trust.

ENHANCE GROUNDED TEXT GENERATION IN ATTRIBUTED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
To enhance grounded text generation, various attributed LLMs have been proposed, falling into two
main paradigms: training-free and training-based. For training-free methods: 1) In-context learning
(Gao et al., 2023b) is used to generate in-line citations with few-shot demonstrations. 2) Post-hoc
attribution (Gao et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2024b) first generates an initial response and then retrieves ev-
idence as attribution. 3) Ji et al. (2024) demonstrate that using chain-of-thought reasoning improves
the quality of text generated with citations. For training-based methods: 1) Asai et al. (2024); Slo-
bodkin et al. (2024); Xia et al. (2024); Ye et al. (2024) apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to LLMs,
training them to identify useful information from documents and guide cited text generation with
them. 2) Beyond simple SFT, recent studies model the task as preference learning, employing Re-
inforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024a). Huang et al. (2024a) proposed a method to improve at-
tribution generation using fine-grained rewards and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman
et al., 2017), while Li et al. (2024a); Huang et al. (2024b) introduced the modified DPO framework
to enhance fine-grained attribution abilities. 3) While many approaches rely on external documents
provided by the user or retrieved during generation, Khalifa et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024a) fo-
cus on tuning LLMs to cite sources from pre-training data using learned parametric knowledge.
In contrast to previous approaches, we introduce TRUST-ALIGN, which advances alignment data
generation through a multi-step process that disentangles answer generation from citation quality.
This separation enables TRUST-ALIGN to simultaneously improve the quality of answer generation,
citation accuracy, and refusal precision. Additionally, TRUST-ALIGN addresses a broader range of
