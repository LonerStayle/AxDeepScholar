Coverage Critic Prompt
[INSTRUCTION]
You will be given Question and the corresponding correct answers, along with a candidate answer and
reference facts.
Please follow these steps to process the candidate answer:
1.
Carefully read and understand the given Question, the list of correct answers, and the candidate
answer.
2.
For each given correct answer, first determine if there is a conflict with the candidate answer:
- If there is no conflict, and it is included in the candidate answer, extract the matched term from the
candidate answer and classify them as "upvote".
- If there is a conflict, identify the specific conflicting span within the candidate answer (accurately
pinpoint the details), classify it as "downvote", then only minimally modify the conflicting part of
the candidate answer to correct it according to the corresponding correct answer (using context from the
reference fact).
Classify the modified span as "revise".
- If there is a conflict, but it is not included in the candidate answer, extend the candidate answer
to include the correct answer (using material from the corresponding part of the reference facts), and
classify the extended portion as "revise".
3.
At the end of your response, provide the following:
- The final revised candidate answer that
includes all correct answers and has no conflicts (if no modification is needed, output the original
one).

Citation Critic Prompt
[INSTRUCTION]
Given a question and a list of CLAIMs, use the provided FACTs to determine which numbered FACTs togeter
SUPPORT, OPPOSE, or are IRRELEVANT to each CLAIM. Follow these to give your judgement:
1.
"SUPPORT" means the FACT directly participates in supporting the factuality of the CLAIM. The CLAIM
should be strongly implied by the FACT.
2.
"OPPOSE" means the FACT contributes to prove the CLAIM contains at least one factual error.
3.
"IRRELEVANT" means the FACT does not contribute directly to either SUPPORT or OPPOSE the given
CLAIM.
4.
Carefully read the given question and FACTs to ensure you have a clear understanding of them.
5.
For each CLAIM, analyze its content to show all factual arguments and assertions.
6.
Look into the details of each FACT, and find factual-related points of each FACT.
7.
Before determining your final judgement for all CLAIMs at the end, state your reasoning and evidence
first.
8.
In your final judgement, give a numbered list with each line corresponding to a CLAIM. Then, for
each CLAIM, separately list the index of each FACT for "SUPPORT", "OPPOSE", and "IRRELEVANT", with the
format [FACT X], where X is the index of the FACT starting from 1.
For example, suppose we have two
CLAIMs and three FACTs in total:
"/n/n1.
SUPPORT: [FACT 1][FACT 3], OPPOSE: NONE, IRRELEVANT: [FACT
2]/n/n2.
SUPPORT: NONE, OPPOSE: [FACT 2], IRRELEVANT: [FACT 1][FACT 3]".
If no FACT, then just give
"NONE".
