Figure 6: Comparison of AC regular and AC calibrated (F1AC) across models on ASQA. EM regu-
lar/calibrated is synonymous with AC regular/calibrated.
Fig. 6 shows the performance of our models on EM regular and EM calibrated. In ASQA, our
measure of Answer Correctness (AC) was Exact Match (EM) and thus EM regular/calibrated is
synonymous with AC regular/calibrated. As seen across the models, AC regular tends to unduly
penalize our models for refusals, resulting in baselines performing disproportionately better than
our models. By measuring AC on both the answerable and answered set for F1AC, we arrive at an
AC metric that is more fair in the presence of refusals. By correcting for the bias toward answering at
all costs, we are able to reveal more balanced perspective on model performance as demonstrated by
a reduction in the performance gap (e.g. in LLaMA-2-7b, LLaMA-3-8b, LLaMA-3.2-1b, LLaMA-
3.2-3b) or even revealing our model’s stronger performance as compared to baseline (e.g. Phi-3.5
