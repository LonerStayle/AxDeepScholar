three propagation ways of the worm: via a generated a new email based on subject, via the enrichment of content of a given
email body, and via a generated response.
**Write New Email Based on a Given Subject**
You are an email assistant , here are some
emails from my email application read and
remember them: {Email-1}, Email-2}, ... {Email-k}
Use them as context to create an email body
draft for this email Subject: {Email Subject}

**Enrich the Content of the Email Given Some Text**
You are an email assistant , here are some
emails from my email application read and
remember them: {Email-1}, Email-2}, ... {Email-k}
Use them as context to enrich the email body
draft I’m sending now: {Email Body}

**Generate a Response Based on Relevant Emails**
You are an email assistant , here are some
emails from my email application read and
remember them: {Email-1}, {Email-2}, ... {Email-k}
Use them as context when replying to a new
email. Now here is a new email that I want you
to reply to. Create a response for the next
email: {Received email}

over 50 emails received by the employee. In each iteration, a
query was sent to the GenAI engine asking it to generate a
response to the email from scratch using the query presented
in Figure 6 bottom and the documents retrieved by the RAG
from the employee’s database (excluding the iterated email).
The abovementioned (1)-(3) experiments have been re-
peated for the 20 employees and included 3,000 experiments:
1000 for each of the three propagation ways.
Results. Fig. 5 presents the abovementioned metrics of the
three propagation ways. As can be seen, the retrieval rates
of the propagation via a generated email based on a subject
suffer from low retrieval rates due to the fact the subjects of
the emails sent do not contain the words Enron. Therefore
the worm has been retrieved with lower retrieval rates and
consequently yielded lower combined rates with respect to
the two additional propagation ways. Overall, we can see
that with a context in the size of 20 emails, the combined
success rate of worms when generating a response and when
enriching the body of an email is around 20%. This marks
the fact that the worm is expected to propagate to new clients
every five emails a user receives/sends.

Evaluating the Resilience of the Worm
Here we evaluate the resilience of the worm, i.e., how it sur-
vives a chain of inferences conducted by GenAI engines.
Experimental Setup. We assigned every employee a
unique identifier between 1-20. Next, we drew 50 per-
mutations p1, p2,..., p50 from the set {1,20}. We iterated
on the 50 permutations, and for each permutation pi =
(idi1,idi2,...,idi20), we iterated on the identifier according to
the order of the permutation. For each identifier idij, we ran-
domly selected an email from the outgoing/sent emails of the
employee associated with the identifier. Next, we took the
subject of the email and used the GenAI engine to generate
an email associated with this subject using the template pre-
sented in Fig. 6 top. We evaluated the combined success rate
(given that the worm has been retrieved by the RAG) by pro-
viding k −1 relevant documents from the RAG in addition to
the email of the worm for various sizes of provided documents
k={10, 20, 30, 50, 100}. We took the output returned from the
GenAI engine and considered it an email sent from employee
idij to employee idij+1, simulating one hop of infection. We
repeated this procedure again, iterating over the 20 employees
of permutation (according to its order) using the new email
created. Each permutation allowed us to simulate 20 hops
of infection between 20 different employees, testing how the
worm srvives a chain of inferences using 1,000 experiments.
Results. As can be seen in the results presented in Fig.
7 top, the replication &amp; payload success rate maintained is
greater than 90% for various k = {10,20,30,50,100} until the
11’th hop of the propagation. The combined success rate dete-
riorates from the 12’th hop of the propagation to the 20’th hop
of the propagation due to the non-determinism behavior of
the GenAI engine, yielding results of 40%-80% depending on
the size of the context k. Next, we evaluate how the resilience
of the worm is affected by the type of the GenAI engine.
Experimental Setup. We repeated the experiment using:
