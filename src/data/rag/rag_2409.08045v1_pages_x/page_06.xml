and context size k (bottom) on the extraction rates.
GenAI engine, and GTE-base-768 [45] for the embeddings
algorithm in all of the experiments performed.
Results. As can be seen from the results presented in Fig.
1 top, the extraction method affects the extraction rate sig-
nificantly. Using the Adaptive Method, attackers can extract
80.6% of the documents in the database used by the Q&amp;A
chatbot. The number of documents that could be extracted
using the Adaptive method is x4 times greater than the results
received by the two other extraction methods that yielded
extraction rates lower than 20%.
Next, we evaluate the influence of the context size (the
number of documents provided by the RAG to the GenAI
engine) on the performance of the RAG documents extraction
attack. To evaluate the influence of the three context sizes (k
= 5, 10, 20), we used the adaptive method as the extraction
method, Gemini 1.5 Flash for the GenAI engine, GTE-base-
768 for the embeddings algorithm, and a total number of 800
queries in all of the experiments performed.
Results. As can be seen from the results presented in
Fig. 1 bottom, for k = 5,10,20, we were able to extract
43.4%,64.5%,80.6% of the documents. This marks that the
extraction rates are highly affected by the context size k.

Evaluating the Influence of the GenAI Engine, Em-
beddings Algorithm, and Space
Here we evaluate the influence of the embeddings algorithm
and its space on the performance of the RAG documents ex-
traction attack using five different embeddings algorithms:
three GTE embeddings [45] algorithms (small-384, base-768,
large-1024), Nomic-768 [46], and MPNet-768 [20]. To evalu-
ate it, we used the adaptive method as the extraction method,
Gemini 1.5 Flash for the GenAI engine, k = 20 for the context
size, and a total of 800 queries in all experiments performed.
Figure 2: The influence of various embeddings algorithms
and sizes (top) and GenAI engine (bottom).
Results. As can be seen from the results presented in Fig. 2,
the extraction rates for GTE-768, MPNet-768, and Nomic-768
are 80.6%, 98.8%, 90.9%, marking that there is a significant
difference of 18.2% in the extraction rates depending on the
target embedding algorithm used for similar sizes. As can
also be seen from the results, the extraction rates for GTE-
384, GTE-768, GTE-1024 are 91.0%, 80.6%, 80.4%, yielding
a difference of 10.6%, marking a significant difference in
extraction rates depending on the size of the embedding algo-
rithm used.
Finally, we evaluate the influence of the GenAI engine on
the performance of the RAG documents extraction attack us-
ing three different GenAI engines: Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemini
1.5 Flash, and GPT-4o Mini. To evaluate it, we used the adap-
tive method as the extraction method, GTE-base-768 for the
embedding algorithm, k = 20 for the context size, and a total
number of 800 queries in all of the experiments performed.
Results. As can be seen from the results presented in Fig.
2, there is a significant difference of in the extraction rates,
depending on the GenAI engine being used by the Q&amp;A
chatbot. This difference is based by the fact that GenAI engine
returned different number of documents on average: Gemini
1.0 Pro returned 4.06 documents on average (σ = 2.76) from
the 20 documents provided by the RAG, yielding extraction
rates of 42.9%. Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o-Mini returned
18.36 (σ = 2.86) and 15.05 (σ = 4.99) documents on average
from the 20 documents provided by the RAG, and therefore
yielded higher extraction rates of 73.6% and 80.6%.
